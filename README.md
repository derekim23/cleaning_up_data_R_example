#This is the readme file for the run_analysis.R script.
It
	* reads in the relevant files
	* merges the multiple datasets into one
	* extracts relevant data
	* changes the "acitivity" variable to a factor variable
	* relables the columns with proper variable names
	* and finally creates an independent tidy dataset
