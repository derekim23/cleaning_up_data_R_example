This is the readme file for the run_analysis.R script.
It
1. reads in the relevant files
2. merges the multiple datasets into one
3. extracts relevant data
4. changes the "acitivity" variable to a factor variable
5. relables the columns with proper variable names
6. and finally creates an independent tidy dataset
